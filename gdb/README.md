# gdb and core dumps

A little program with null pointer use.

To compile, use:

```(bash)
make
```

Then allow coredumps:

```(bash)
ulimit -S -c unlimited
```

Run:

```(bash)
./null_
```

There will be a message like this:

```
[1]    15796 segmentation fault (core dumped)  ./null_
```

In the directory there will be the file "*core*".

Run gdb:

```(bash)
gdb null_
```

Then specify the core dump:

```
core core
```

There will be a message:

```
[New LWP 15796]
Core was generated by `./null_'.
Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
#0  func_1 (pointer=0x0) at source/main.cpp:12
12	    func_2();
```

To see the backtrace, use:

```
bt
```

And there it is:

```
#0  func_1 (pointer=0x0) at source/main.cpp:12
#1  func_2 () at source/main.cpp:8
#2  main () at source/main.cpp:12
```
